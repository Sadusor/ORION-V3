# ORION V3 — Current Handoff

## Current exact situation

The common ORION WorkPackage execution envelope was physically proven in
V3-RUN-020.

The current work is qualification of a mature semantic Coding Hand.

OpenHands Agent SDK is under investigation.

Physically proven healthy:
- Qwen3.6 native structured tool calling through Ollama;
- direct LiteLLM 1.93.0 structured tool calling;
- direct OpenHands `LLM.generate()` with resolved TerminalTool;
- the same wrapper with OpenHands security-risk schema injection;
- TerminalTool/FileEditorTool registration;
- real Agent system-prompt tool advertisement.

Physically failing:
- full OpenHands Agent/Conversation path produces textual tool syntax instead
  of a structured ActionEvent.

RUN-027's process-level FAIL was cleanup-only:
the actual security-OFF and security-ON LLM wrapper diagnostics both passed,
then Windows refused to delete a temp directory still held by the Terminal
executor.

## Next action

Do not swap models yet.

Audit the exact OpenHands Agent message/system-prompt/history preparation path.

Build one small comparison with:
- same Qwen3.6 model;
- same OpenHands LLM wrapper;
- same resolved TerminalTool;
- case A: known-good minimal direct messages;
- case B: exact messages prepared by the full Agent conversation.

Capture:
- serialized messages;
- full system prompt hash/text boundary;
- dynamic context;
- tool schema;
- native_tool_calling;
- final LiteLLM kwargs;
- raw response;
- OpenHands converted Message;
- response classification.

The first layer where case B changes native structured tool calling into textual
tool syntax is the defect boundary.

## Operator workflow

Use legacy ORION Remote:

`CHECK GITHUB -> APPROVE & RUN`

Do not ask the owner to paste PowerShell unless Remote cannot execute the gate.

Always inspect durable named-session JSON before accepting phone UI PASS/FAIL as
truth.
