# ORION V3 Status

Updated: 2026-10-04

## Stage

Bootstrap / OpenJarvis Foundation Gate 1.

ORION-V3 is a completely separate repository from the proven ORION implementation.

## Current claims

- Donor contract probe: PASS (session `92c002cdf162`)
- architecture: DOCUMENTED
- OpenJarvis substrate: CANDIDATE, not adopted
- Authority Boundary V0: DRAFT
- Gate-1 runtime: NOT TESTED
- old ORION Remote: frozen external fallback; untouched

## Pinned OpenJarvis donor

`Sadusor/OpenJarvis@309a4f1044ccfb2032264832a31fef2f1d314586`

## Current bounded task

Re-run `E2E Authority V1 - Freeze Plan` after fail-closed attempt 01. Surgical fix: ORION now owns/defaults only `network=denied` and `extra_writes=denied`; all execution-bearing planner fields must still match exactly and unknown/conflicting fields fail closed. Hand execution remains blocked until an exact frozen plan SHA is produced and explicitly approved.

## Gate-1 attacks

1. no lease;
2. forged lease;
3. expired lease;
4. wrong operation or scope;
5. native Jarvis agent direct invocation;
6. side-effect tool outside ORION profile;
7. Jarvis policy accidentally open-by-default;
8. Jarvis capability widening while ORION denies;
9. model attempts to inject trusted roots;
10. blocking operation plus Stop;
11. donor telemetry mistaken for canonical state.
