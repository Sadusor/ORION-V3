# ORION V3 Status

Updated: 2026-10-04

## Stage

Bootstrap / OpenJarvis Foundation Gate 1.

ORION-V3 is a completely separate repository from the proven ORION implementation.

## Current claims

- Evidence Pack concurrency repair: PASS (`aee352d7f379`)
- E2E Authority Proof V1: PASS (prepare `71c7f7cbccb3`, execute `9c623d9e5be6`)
- Donor contract probe: PASS (session `92c002cdf162`)
- architecture: DOCUMENTED
- OpenJarvis substrate: CANDIDATE, not adopted
- Authority Boundary V0: DRAFT
- Gate-1 runtime: NOT TESTED
- old ORION Remote: frozen external fallback; untouched

## Pinned OpenJarvis donor

`Sadusor/OpenJarvis@309a4f1044ccfb2032264832a31fef2f1d314586`

## Current bounded task

Re-run `E2E Authority V2 - Qwen Freeze Plan` with Qwen thinking ON. The earlier thinking-OFF prepare PASS is retained as evidence but its frozen plan hash is superseded and must not be executed. V2 now binds `interpreter_thinking=true` into the canonical plan hash. New V3 phone UI alpha begins after full V2 PASS.

## Gate-1 attacks

1. no lease;
2. forged lease;
3. expired lease;
4. wrong operation or scope;
5. native Jarvis agent direct invocation;
6. side-effect tool outside ORION profile;
7. Jarvis policy accidentally open-by-default;
8. Jarvis capability widening while ORION denies;
9. model attempts to inject trusted roots;
10. blocking operation plus Stop;
11. donor telemetry mistaken for canonical state.
